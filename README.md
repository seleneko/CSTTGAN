# CSTTGAN

Due to the widespread use of mobile devices and location-aware technology, there has been a noticeable increase in the collection and utilization of personal trajectory data. However, it is important to recognize that personal trajectory data contains sensitive information about individuals, including their home and workplace locations. The disclosure of such information can potentially lead to privacy breaches and security threats. Consequently, safeguarding the privacy of trajectory data has emerged as a crucial concern. In this study, our aim is to investigate the potential weaknesses of conventional methods employed to protect trajectory privacy. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for trajectory privacy attack and preservation based on machine learning techniques. To accomplish this, we enhance the Transformer model using multiple approaches and design a generative adversarial network called CST2GAN, which not only generates synthetic trajectories from real data but also has the capacity to recover original trajectories from desensitized ones. We devise a sound loss function for the CST2GAN model through mathematical derivation. Subsequently, we conduct an experimental evaluation on a real-world trajectory dataset. The results of our experiments demonstrate that our approach yields substantial outcomes in preserving trajectory privacy while also challenging conventional privacy protection methods. Furthermore, it exhibits commendable resilience and scalability.
